The fcc-textify package is a set of tools to make the contents of FCC PDF
comments searchable by creating a parallel database of comment filings
in which the text of comment documents have been extracted and indexed.

There are two modes of operation:

When the system is first initialized, all comments are
bootstrapped into the database.

Subsequent updates then need to be as new comments are added to the FCC database.

Bootstrapping:


Maintenance mode:

Invoke 
    
    python proceeding.py run

Once a day to fetch new comments for all currently open proceedings.

Invoke

    run-task auth/production/injector inject 

once an hour to queue documents into the ocr system.

Invoke

    run-task auth/production/collector collect
 

Once an hour or more frequently to update the database with
processed data.

The actual extraction occurs on extraction nodes, which are configured
to run automatically

On an extraction node, invoke

    run-task auth/production/worker extract_online

or
    run-task auth/production/worker extract_batch

The former updates a queue when the extraction is complete, the latter does
not.
